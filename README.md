## Hi there 👋

<!--
**Tomrgn/Tomrgn** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

French nurse with a Master's degree in Law (UT1 Capitole).  
Currently preparing for the **EPSO AD5 Generalist competition** (2026 cycle) to join the European Commission — with a strong interest in **DG REFORM** and the Reform and Investment Task Force.

This GitHub is where I "vibe code" small tools, scripts and prototypes — mostly using AI assistance to turn ideas into working code quickly.  
It's my way to show I can learn fast, solve problems creatively, and bring a multidisciplinary perspective (health + law + public administration) to digital / reform projects.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on ... small automation tools and data helpers to support public policy / reform work (mostly Python + AI-generated code)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Python basics, prompt engineering, GitHub workflows + how to "vibe code" efficiently with large language models
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on ... beginner-friendly open-source tools related to public administration, EU policies, health data, or legal document processing
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with ... understanding clean code practices, debugging, and turning policy/reform ideas into simple, useful scripts
- 💬 Ask me about ... nursing in France, French/EU administrative law, EPSO competition preparation, or how non-coders can start "vibe coding"
- 😄 Pronouns: ... He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... I went from taking care of patients at night to studying case law at university — and now I'm teaching myself to code with AI to help make public reforms better!

Thanks for stopping by 🌿  
Feel free to open an issue or say hello if something interests you!
